== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does BETA mean? =

This plugin is being released to the public to get feedback and improve.  It has been tested internally and functions well, but there might be some bugs or general user experience problems.  If you find these, please [let us know](https://www.angelleye.com/support)!

= Do I have to have a PayPal account in order to use IfThenGive? =

Yes.  The IfThenGive system is built entirely on the PayPal platform.

= What does it mean that Billing Agreements are required? =

When somebody sets up a billing agreement with you, this allows you (your application) to process payments on their behalf at any time.  This requires approval by PayPal, and it needs to be specifically enabled on your account.  If this is not done, this plugin will not work properly for you!
